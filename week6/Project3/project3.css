/* Your website must include:
A navbar (this will be a single page website so functional links are not needed), header, footer, and a main section.
The main section must include at minimum:  image(s), text, list(s), and table(s). Feel free to add other elements as you 
 see fit. Remember: coding is about practicing code!
At least 3 media queries (mobile, tablet, and desktop). Remember to use the mobile-first approach when styling this 
 website.
You must use:
CSS grid for the layout, and at least one example of CSS flexbox for aligning elements
A google font (you will need to go to fonts.google.com (Links to an external site.) and get the url for a <link /> on 
 their HTML page)
CSS style sheet (no inline styling)
Note: Donâ€™t forget proper spacing (box model)
Now examine the responsiveness. Open your completed webpage in your browser. Open Chrome DevTools's Device Toolbar and 
 check the responsiveness of your webpage. */
