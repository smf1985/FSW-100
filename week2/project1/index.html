    <h1>The Causes of Climate Change</h1>
    <h2>The Greenhouse Effect</h2>

    <h4>We Live in a Greenhouse</h4>
    <p>Life on Earth depends on energy coming from the Sun. About half the light reaching Earth's atmosphere passes
        through the air and clouds to the surface, where it is absorbed and then radiated upward in the form of
        infrared heat. About <b>90 percent</b> of this heat is then absorbed by the greenhouse gases and radiated back toward
        the surface.</p>
    <p>Scientists attribute the global warming trend observed since the mid-20th century to the human expansion of the
        "greenhouse effect" â€” warming that results when the atmosphere traps heat radiating from Earth toward space.</p>
    <p>Certain gases in the atmosphere block heat from escaping. Long-lived gases that remain semi-permanently in
        the atmosphere and do not respond physically or chemically to changes in temperature are described as
        "forcing" climate change. Gases, such as water vapor, which respond physically or chemically to changes
        in temperature are seen as "feedbacks."</p>
    <span>Gases that contribute to the greenhouse effect include:</span>
    <ol>
        <li>Nitrous oxide</li>
        <li>Carbon Dioxide</li>
        <li>Methane</li>
        <li>Water Vapo</li>
    </ol>
