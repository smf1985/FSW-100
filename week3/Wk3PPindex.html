            <h3>Miguel</h3>
            <p>My father is the oldest of 9 kids. Although a couple of his younger siblings were born in the United States, the others were born 
                in Mexico and moved here while still in school.</p>

        <h3>Stephanie</h3>
        <p>I'm an only child. While I have been to California many times throughout my life, I've only been to Mexico once and that was just into
            TJ. I know I have family there that I've never met and I'd really like to change that one day. </p>
