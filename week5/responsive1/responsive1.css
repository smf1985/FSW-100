/* Using CSS Grid and a media query, create a web page that looks like this:
Here are the colors:
#F5C6D6
#EE2E84
#85CFD8
#8DC63F
#E76E34
To practice media queries, you must make this color grid keep its regular form (look like the picture above) from large 
 screens down until 768px. Once it gets below 768px, each color must expand to the full-width of its container, so it 
 looks like this:
(This image is zoomed out so as to be able to show all the colors. Your boxes will remain the same height and space 
 apart/same size white border as above.) */
